# Creating a R Markdown document: database

You see how it behaves:

```{r}
a <- 25 # Create integers
b <- 5.5 # create dobles
c <- 2

c <- a+b+c
c

d = a+b
print(d)
```


Italic text: *my_function* , _my_function_

Bold text: **importante** , __importante__

CNTRL + ALT + I, new cell *chunk* of R code.

```{r}
v <- c(1,2,3)

print(v)

my.string <- "Remember that string can be defined with quotation marks or with single quotation marks"

my.string

# What happens if I write:
a; b; c <- 5; 2; 'hola'; c

# You decide how you prefere your documents.

```

# Objects in memory

You can do code format in your document. Try the command **`ls`** to see all the objects that we have stored in memory:

```{r}
ls()
```


On some occasions, we will find that we have stored too large objects in memory, that once an operation has been carried out, we want to eliminate. 

For this, we have the **`rm`** function, to which, we will pass the name as a parameter of the variable to remove.

```{r}
rm(c)
print(ls())
```


## Comments

In R we have two type of comments:

* one line, we will simply use the operator **`#`** and add the comment.

* Multi-line, for this we will open the comment with double quotes **`"`** and, until we include double quotes again, the comment will not be closed.


```{r}
"
Comentario
de
varias
lÃ­neas
"
```


To make our work easier, in **R**, several lines can be commented at the same time, for this we will do:

* Selection of lines

* On the selected lines: CNTRL + SHIFT + C

```{r}

"I want to comment this text"

z<-4

"and this variable that I will not use anymore."

```



# Let us discuss the following:

Given these assignations,

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 6.22
z <- 13 
w <- 4
```

how can we determine if they are odd or not using arithmetic operators?

```{r}
x%%2

y/2

y%%2

13%/%2

4%%2
```


## Packages:

```{r}
text1 <- cat("Hi", "guys")
typeof(text1)
text1

# Here, there is no print workins as in Python
text2 <- paste("Hi", "guys")
text2
text2[1]
typeof(text2)
is.atomic(text2)
is.vector(text2)

# library(stringr)
text3 <- str_c("Hi", "guys")
typeof(text3)
is.atomic(text3)
is.vector(text3)
is.list(text3)

str_dup("hola",6)

```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
